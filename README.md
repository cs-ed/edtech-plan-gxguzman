# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this Educational Technology Plan is to introduce students to computer science. Currently, I teach Career Explorer and plan on offering this introduction to computer science course as an additional module to the elective. 

The module will be called Introduction to Computer Science. This module will start with guiding students through Digital Citizenship and Introduction to the Internet. The learning outcomes for this module will be to introduce students to computer science and equip students with the tools to be responsible digital technology consumers. 

## Context

### Course

The name of the course will be “Intro to Computer Science.” This course will focus on introducing students to basic computer skills and programming. It will be offered to 7th and 8th grade students. 

### Situation

Currently, I teach at Cesar Chavez Middle School which is situated within the Lynwood Unified School District. There are 702 students enrolled with 97.1% of the students being Hispanic/Latino, 2.2% Black/African American, and .7% White.  The school serves a student population that is 93.1% Socioeconomically Disadvantaged. 

This school year the district has implemented a 1:1 computer program. Students that forget their chromebooks at home can check one out at the library. This ensures that students will have access to a device everyday. 

The major concern is internet access at home. The school site is equipped with reliable wifi internet, but Lynwood does not have reliable connection for students that are using hotspots. The bulk of the work will be completed during school hours, and limit the amount of work outside of school hours. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

The main platform/curriculum that will be used is going to be CodeHS. This being an introductory computer science course, the goal is going to be building interest by incorporating two units from CodeHS. The following introductory units will be added to the rotation. 

Digital Citizenship
- Digital Footprint and Reputation
- Cyberbullying
- Internet Safety
- Privacy and Security
- Information Literacy
- Creative Credit and Copyright

Digital Information
- How digital data is represented
- Encoding data
- Converting and using different number systems (Binary, Hexadecimal)
- RGB encoding
- Manipulating images at the pixel level

Other platforms the will be used for communication and grading are the following:
- Google Workspace
- GoGuardian
- Parent Square
- Aeries 


### Hardware Specifications

Instructor:
- HP EliteBook 850 G5 Notebook PC
- 3.90 GHz, 4-core, Intel CPU
- 8 GB RAM
- 512 GB SSD Storage

Student:
- HP Chromebook x360 11MK G3 EE 
- 2.60 GHz, 2-core, Intel CPU
- 8 GB RAM
- 32 GB eMMC


Classroom
- Promethean ActivPanel
- Wifi

### Application

All activities will be planned to be completed during class time. The goal is to maximize the amount of work students are able to complete in a 55 minute period. The main purpose of this course is to expose students to computer programming. Additionally, students will gain experience with the various programming languages. Being that this course will be two additional modules within my Career Explorer elective, the focus will be on students getting hands-on experience on computer programming and career pathways available. 

### Impacts

The technology helps all students learn as modifications are made based on student needs. In case of a move to virtual learning, students are already equipped with a Chromebook. The reasoning behind choosing to incorporate CodeHS into the module rotation is due to students having a limited understanding of how they can use technology in a positive way. CodeHS provides an established curriculum that will allow me to monitor the other modules, too. The main concern is connectivity. The school has provided hotspots to students that chose virtual learning this semester. Additionally, the school was able to provide hotspots to most students during the 2020-2021 school year. This is an area that will need to be addressed more closely, as there are some areas within Lynwood that have poor download speeds.
