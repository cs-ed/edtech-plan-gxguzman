# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this Educational Technology Plan is to introduce students to computer science. Currently, I teach
Career Explorer and plan on offering this computer science course as an additional module to the career explorer
elective. The long term goal is to teach this course as a stand alone elective. 

## Context

### Course

The name of the course will be “Intro to Computer Science.” This course will focus on introducing students to basic computer skills and programming. It will be offered to 7th and 8th grade students. 

### Situation

Currently, I teach at Cesar Chavez Middle School which is situated within the Lynwood Unified School District. There are 702 students enrolled with 97.1% of the students being Hispanic/Latino, 2.2% Black/African American, and .7% White.  The school serves a student population that is 93.1% Socioeconomically Disadvantaged. 

This school year the district has implemented a 1:1 computer program. Students that forget their chromebooks at home can check one out at the library. This ensures that students will have access to a device everyday. 


## Plan

### Software Specifications

The main platform/curriculum that will be used is going to be CodeHS. This being an introductory computer science course, the goal is going to be building interest within the school. The other platform that will be used is Scratch.

Other platforms the will be used for communication and grading are the following:

- Google Workspace
- GoGuardian
- Parent Square
- Aeries 


### Hardware Specifications

Teacher
- HP EliteBook 850 G5 Notebook PC

Student
- HP Chromebook x360 11MK G3 EE 

Classroom
- Promethean ActivPanel
- Wifi

### Application

All activities will be planned to be completed during class time. The main purpose of this course is to expose students to computer programming. Additionally, students will gain experience with the various programming languages. Being that this course will be a module within my Career Explorer elective, the focus will be on students getting hands-on experience on computer programming and career pathways available.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
